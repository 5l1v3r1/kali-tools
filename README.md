# Kali Tools

This repo gives access to **all kali tools**, on every Linux distributions. More specifically, it clones the source repo of the packages (and install them if needed).

Additionnally, it allows **searching** for tools, a feature I was dearly missing. Searching works on packages name **and descriptions** (which were curated, then hardcoded in this repo to avoid unneeded net access).

| Package sqlmap 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Description:
| sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and
| exploiting sql injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a
| powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester and a broad
| range of switches lasting from database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, to
| accessing the underlying file system and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band
| connections.
