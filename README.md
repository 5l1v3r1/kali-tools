# KALI-TOOLS

This repo gives access to all kali tools, on every distributions. More specifically, it clones the source repo of the packages (and install them if needed).

Additionnally, it allows *searching* for tools, a feature I was dearly missing. Searching works on packages name *and* descriptions (which were curated, then hardcoded in this repo to avoid unneeded net access).
