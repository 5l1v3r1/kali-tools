desc['acccheck'] = "The tool is designed as a password dictionary attack tool that targets windows authentication via the SMB protocol. It is really a wrapper script around the ‘smbclient’ binary, and as a result is dependent on it for its execution."
desc['ace-voip'] = "ACE (Automated Corporate Enumerator) is a simple yet powerful VoIP Corporate Directory enumeration tool that mimics the behavior of an IP Phone in order to download the name and extension entries that a given phone can display on its screen interface. In the same way that the “corporate directory” feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from “VoIP Hopper” to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools."
desc['aircrack-ng'] = "Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools."
desc['amap'] = "Amap was the first next-generation scanning tool for pentesters. It attempts to identify applications even if they are running on a different port than normal. It also identifies non-ascii based applications. This is achieved by sending trigger packets, and looking up the responses in a list of response strings."

desc['apache-users'] = "This Perl script will enumerate the usernames on any system that uses Apache with the UserDir module."
desc['apktool'] = "It is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications; it makes possible to debug smali code step by step. Also it makes working with app easier because of project-like files structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc. It is NOT intended for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing, adding some features or support for custom platforms and other GOOD purposes. Just try to be fair with authors of an app, that you use and probably like."
desc['arachni'] = "Arachni is an Open Source, feature-full, modular, high-performance Ruby framework aimed towards helping penetration testers and administrators evaluate the security of web applications. It is smart, it trains itself by learning from the HTTP responses it receives during the audit process and is able to perform meta-analysis using a number of factors in order to correctly assess the trustworthiness of results and intelligently identify false-positives. It is versatile enough to cover a great deal of use cases, ranging from a simple command line scanner utility, to a global high performance grid of scanners, to a Ruby library allowing for scripted audits, to a multi-user multi-scan web collaboration platform."

desc['backdoor-factory'] = "The goal of BDF is patch executable binaries with user desidered shellcode and continue normal execution of the prepatched state. Supporting: Windows PE x32/x64 and Linux ELF x32/x64 (System V). Some executables have built in protections, as such this will not work on all binaries. It is advisable that you test target binaries before deploying them to clients or using them in exercises."
desc['bbqsql'] = "Blind SQL injection can be a pain to exploit. When the available tools work they work well, but when they don’t you have to write something custom. This is time-consuming and tedious. BBQSQL can help you address those issues. BBQSQL is a blind SQL injection framework written in Python. It is extremely useful when attacking tricky SQL injection vulnerabilities. BBQSQL is also a semi-automatic tool, allowing quite a bit of customization for those hard to trigger SQL injection findings. The tool is built to be database agnostic and is extremely versatile.

desc['blueranger'] = "BlueRanger is a simple Bash script which uses Link Quality to locate Bluetooth device radios. It sends l2cap (Bluetooth) pings to create a connection between Bluetooth interfaces, since most devices allow pings without any authentication or authorization. The higher the link quality, the closer the device (in theory). Use a Bluetooth Class 1 adapter for long range location detection. Switch to a Class 3 adapter for more precise short range locating. The recision and accuracy depend on the build quality of the Bluetooth adapter, interference, and response from the remote device. Fluctuations may occur even when neither device is in motion."
desc['bluesnarfer'] = "A Bluetooth bluesnarfing Utility."
desc['braa'] = "Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course making SNMP queries – but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process. Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data types, and in any case cannot be stated ‘standard-conforming’! It was designed to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of my laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa – you HAVE to know the numerical values of OID’s (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0)."
desc['bulk-extractor'] = "bulk_extractor is a program that extracts features such as email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and other types of information from digital evidence files.

desc['cookie-cadger'] = "Cookie Cadger helps identify information leakage from applications that utilize insecure HTTP GET requests. Web providers have started stepping up to the plate since Firesheep was released in 2010. Today, most major websites can provide SSL/TLS during all transactions, preventing cookie data from leaking over wired Ethernet or insecure Wi-Fi. But the fact remains that Firesheep was more of a toy than a tool. Cookie Cadger is the first open-source pen-testing tool ever made for intercepting and replaying specific insecure HTTP GET requests into a browser. Cookie Cadgers Request Enumeration Abilities Cookie Cadger is a graphical utility which harnesses the power of the Wireshark suite and Java to provide a fully cross-platform, entirely open- source utility which can monitor wired Ethernet, insecure Wi-Fi, or load a packet capture file for offline analysis."

desc['cowpatty'] = "Implementation of an offline dictionary attack against WPA/WPA2 networks using PSK-based authentication (e.g. WPA-Personal). Many enterprise networks deploy PSK-based authentication mechanisms for WPA/WPA2 since it is much easier than establishing the necessary RADIUS, supplicant and certificate authority architecture needed for WPA-Enterprise authentication. Cowpatty can implement an accelerated attack if a precomputed PMK file is available for the SSID that is being assessed."
desc['crackle'] = "crackle exploits a flaw in the BLE pairing process that allows an attacker to guess or very quickly brute force the TK (Temporary Key).
