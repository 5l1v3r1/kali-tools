desc['acccheck'] = "The tool is designed as a password dictionary attack tool that targets windows authentication via the SMB protocol. It is really a wrapper script around the ‘smbclient’ binary, and as a result is dependent on it for its execution."
desc['ace-voip'] = "ACE (Automated Corporate Enumerator) is a simple yet powerful VoIP Corporate Directory enumeration tool that mimics the behavior of an IP Phone in order to download the name and extension entries that a given phone can display on its screen interface. In the same way that the “corporate directory” feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from “VoIP Hopper” to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools."
desc['aircrack-ng'] = "Aircrack-ng is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured. It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations like KoreK attacks, as well as the all-new PTW attack, thus making the attack much faster compared to other WEP cracking tools."
desc['amap'] = "Amap was the first next-generation scanning tool for pentesters. It attempts to identify applications even if they are running on a different port than normal. It also identifies non-ascii based applications. This is achieved by sending trigger packets, and looking up the responses in a list of response strings."
desc['android-sdk'] = "The Android SDK provides you the API libraries and developer tools necessary to build, test, and debug apps for Android."
desc['apache-users'] = "This Perl script will enumerate the usernames on any system that uses Apache with the UserDir module."
desc['apktool'] = "It is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after making some modifications; it makes possible to debug smali code step by step. Also it makes working with app easier because of project-like files structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building apk, etc. It is NOT intended for piracy and other non-legal uses. It could be used for localizing, adding some features or support for custom platforms and other GOOD purposes. Just try to be fair with authors of an app, that you use and probably like."
desc['arachni'] = "Arachni is an Open Source, feature-full, modular, high-performance Ruby framework aimed towards helping penetration testers and administrators evaluate the security of web applications. It is smart, it trains itself by learning from the HTTP responses it receives during the audit process and is able to perform meta-analysis using a number of factors in order to correctly assess the trustworthiness of results and intelligently identify false-positives. It is versatile enough to cover a great deal of use cases, ranging from a simple command line scanner utility, to a global high performance grid of scanners, to a Ruby library allowing for scripted audits, to a multi-user multi-scan web collaboration platform."

Armitage is a force multiplier for red team operations."
desc['asleap'] = "Demonstrates a serious deficiency in proprietary Cisco LEAP networks. Since LEAP uses a variant of MS-CHAPv2 for the authentication exchange, it is susceptible to accelerated offline dictionary attacks. Asleap can also attack the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP), and any MS-CHAPv2 exchange where you can specify the challenge and response values on the command line."
desc['automater'] = "Automater is a URL/Domain, IP Address, and Md5 Hash OSINT tool aimed at making the analysis process easier for intrusion Analysts. Given a target (URL, IP, or HASH) or a file full of targets Automater will return relevant results from sources like the following: IPvoid.com, Robtex.com, Fortiguard.com, unshorten.me, Urlvoid.com, Labs.alienvault.com, ThreatExpert, VxVault, and VirusTotal."
desc['backdoor-factory'] = "The goal of BDF is patch executable binaries with user desidered shellcode and continue normal execution of the prepatched state. Supporting: Windows PE x32/x64 and Linux ELF x32/x64 (System V). Some executables have built in protections, as such this will not work on all binaries. It is advisable that you test target binaries before deploying them to clients or using them in exercises."
desc['bbqsql'] = "Blind SQL injection can be a pain to exploit. When the available tools work they work well, but when they don’t you have to write something custom. This is time-consuming and tedious. BBQSQL can help you address those issues. BBQSQL is a blind SQL injection framework written in Python. It is extremely useful when attacking tricky SQL injection vulnerabilities. BBQSQL is also a semi-automatic tool, allowing quite a bit of customization for those hard to trigger SQL injection findings. The tool is built to be database agnostic and is extremely versatile. It also has an intuitive UI to make setting up attacks much easier. Python gevent is also implemented, making BBQSQL extremely fast."
desc['bed'] = "BED is a program which is designed to check daemons for potential buffer overflows, format strings et. al."
desc['beef'] = "BeEF is short for The Browser Exploitation Framework. It is a penetration testing tool that focuses on the web browser. Amid growing concerns about web-borne attacks against clients, including mobile clients, BeEF allows the professional penetration tester to assess the actual security posture of a target environment by using client-side attack vectors. Unlike other security frameworks, BeEF looks past the hardened network perimeter and client system, and examines exploitability within the context of the one open door: the web browser. BeEF will hook one or more web browsers and use them as beachheads for launching directed command modules and further attacks against the system from within the browser context."
desc['bing-ip2hosts'] = "Bing.com is a search engine owned by Microsoft formerly known as MSN Search and Live Search. It has a unique feature to search for websites hosted on a specific IP address. Bing-ip2hosts uses this feature to enumerate all hostnames which Bing has indexed for a specific IP address. This technique is considered best practice during the reconnaissance phase of a penetration test in order to discover a larger potential attack surface. Bing-ip2hosts is written in the Bash scripting language for Linux. This uses the mobile interface and no API key is required."
desc['binwalk'] = "Binwalk is a tool for searching a given binary image for embedded files and executable code. Specifically, it is designed for identifying files and code embedded inside of firmware images. Binwalk uses the libmagic library, so it is compatible with magic signatures created for the Unix file utility. Binwalk also includes a custom magic signature file which contains improved signatures for files that are commonly found in firmware images such as compressed/archived files, firmware headers, Linux kernels, bootloaders, filesystems, etc."
desc['blindelephant'] = "The BlindElephant Web Application Fingerprinter attempts to discover the version of a (known) web application by comparing static files at known locations against precomputed hashes for versions of those files in all all available releases.

It can be used for testing BT-devices for known vulnerabilities and major thing to do – testing to find unknown vulns. Also it can form nice statistics."
desc['bluepot'] = "Bluepot is a Bluetooth Honeypot written in Java, it runs on Linux. Bluepot was a third year university project attempting to implement a fully functional Bluetooth Honeypot. A piece of software designed to accept and store any malware sent to it and interact with common Bluetooth attacks such as “BlueBugging?” and “BlueSnarfing?”. Bluetooth connectivity is provided via hardware Bluetooth dongles. The system also allows monitoring of attacks via a graphical user interface that provides graphs, lists, a dashboard and further detailed analysis from log files."
desc['blueranger'] = "BlueRanger is a simple Bash script which uses Link Quality to locate Bluetooth device radios. It sends l2cap (Bluetooth) pings to create a connection between Bluetooth interfaces, since most devices allow pings without any authentication or authorization. The higher the link quality, the closer the device (in theory). Use a Bluetooth Class 1 adapter for long range location detection. Switch to a Class 3 adapter for more precise short range locating. The recision and accuracy depend on the build quality of the Bluetooth adapter, interference, and response from the remote device. Fluctuations may occur even when neither device is in motion."
desc['bluesnarfer'] = "A Bluetooth bluesnarfing Utility."
desc['braa'] = "Braa is a mass snmp scanner. The intended usage of such a tool is of course making SNMP queries – but unlike snmpget or snmpwalk from net-snmp, it is able to query dozens or hundreds of hosts simultaneously, and in a single process. Thus, it consumes very few system resources and does the scanning VERY fast.Braa implements its OWN snmp stack, so it does NOT need any SNMP libraries like net-snmp. The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data types, and in any case cannot be stated ‘standard-conforming’! It was designed to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of my laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa – you HAVE to know the numerical values of OID’s (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0)."
desc['bulk-extractor'] = "bulk_extractor is a program that extracts features such as email addresses, credit card numbers, URLs, and other types of information from digital evidence files. It is a useful forensic investigation tool for many tasks such as malware and intrusion investigations, identity investigations and cyber investigations, as well as analyzing imagery and pass-word cracking."
desc['bully'] = "Bully is a new implementation of the WPS brute force attack, written in C. It is conceptually identical to other programs, in that it exploits the (now well known) design flaw in the WPS specification. It has several advantages over the original reaver code. These include fewer dependencies, improved memory and cpu performance, correct handling of endianness, and a more robust set of options. It runs on Linux, and was specifically developed to run on embedded Linux systems (OpenWrt, etc) regardless of architecture. Bully provides several improvements in the detection and handling of anomalous scenarios. It has been tested against access points from numerous vendors, and with differing configurations, with much success."
desc['burpsuite'] = "Burp Suite is an integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
