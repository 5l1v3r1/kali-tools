In the same way that the “corporate directory” feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from “VoIP Hopper” to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools."

The implementation is very dirty, supports only several data types, and in any case cannot be stated ‘standard-conforming’! It was designed to be fast, and it is fast. For this reason (well, and also because of my laziness ;), there is no ASN.1 parser in braa – you HAVE to know the numerical values of OID’s (for instance .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 instead of system.sysName.0)."

Works in command line interface, so information dumps could be redirected by pipes with tools such as grep, awk, cut, sed… Dumpzilla allows to visualize following sections, search customization and extract certain content."
desc['eapmd5pass'] = "EAP-MD5 is a legacy authentication mechanism that does not provide sufficient protection for user authentication credentials. Users who authenticate using EAP-MD5 subject themselves to an offline dictionary attack vulnerability. This tool reads from a live network interface in monitor-mode, or from a stored libpcap capture file, and extracts the portions of the EAP-MD5 authentication exchange. Once the challenge and response portions have been collected from this exchange, eapmd5pass will mount an offline dictionary attack against the user’s password."

Its aim is to serve as the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, and other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away."
desc['extundelete'] = "extundelete is a utility that can recover deleted files from an ext3 or ext4 partition. The ext3 and ext4 file systems are the most common default file systems in Linux distributions like Mint, Mageia, or Ubuntu. extundelete uses information stored in the partition’s journal to attempt to recover a file that has been deleted from the partition. There is no guarantee that any particular file will be able to be undeleted, so always try to have a good backup system in place, or at least put one in place after recovering your files."

It is meant specifically to locate likely targets both inside and outside a corporate network. Only those targets are listed (unless the -nopattern switch is used). No exploitation is performed (unless you do something intentionally malicious with the -connect switch). Fierce is a reconnaissance tool. Fierce is a PERL script that quickly scans domains (usually in just a few minutes, assuming no network lag) using several tactics."

Fiked can impersonate a VPN gateway’s IKE responder in order to capture XAUTH login credentials; it doesn’t currently do the client part of full MitM."
desc['fimap'] = "fimap is a little python tool which can find, prepare, audit, exploit and even google automaticly for local and remote file inclusion bugs in webapps. fimap should be something like sqlmap just for LFI/RFI bugs instead of sql injection. It’s currently under heavy development but it’s usable."
desc['findmyhash'] = "indmyhash.py try to crack different types of hashes using free online services."
desc['firewalk'] = "Firewalk is an active reconnaissance network security tool that attempts to determine what layer 4 protocols a given IP forwarding device will pass. Firewalk works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway. If the gateway allows the traffic, it will forward the packets to the next hop where they will expire and elicit an ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED message. If the gateway hostdoes not allow the traffic, it will likely drop the packets on the floor and we will see no response. To get the correct IP TTL that will result in expired packets one beyond the gateway we need to ramp up hop-counts. We do this in the same manner that traceroute works. Once we have the gateway hopcount (at that point the scan is said to be `bound`) we can begin our scan. It is significant to note the fact that the ultimate destination host does not have to be reached. It just needs to be somewhere downstream, on the other side of the gateway, from the scanning host."
desc['foremost'] = "Foremost is a forensic program to recover lost files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures. Foremost can work on image files, such as those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more reliable and faster recovery."
desc['fragroute'] = "fragroute intercepts, modifies, and rewrites egress traffic destined for a specified host, implementing most of the attacks described in the Secure Networks “Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection” paper of January 1998. It features a simple ruleset language to delay, duplicate, drop, fragment, overlap, print, reorder, segment, source-route, or otherwise monkey with all outbound packets destined for a target host, with minimal support for randomized or probabilistic behaviour."
desc['fragrouter'] = "Fragrouter is a network intrusion detection evasion toolkit. It implements most of the attacks described in the Secure Networks “Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection” paper of January 1998. This program was written in the hopes that a more precise testing methodology might be applied to the area of network intrusion detection, which is still a black art at best. Conceptually, fragrouter is just a one-way fragmenting router – IP packets get sent from the attacker to the fragrouter, which transforms them into a fragmented data stream to forward to the victim."
